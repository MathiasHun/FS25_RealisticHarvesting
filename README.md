## 🎯 What Does This Mod Do?

**Realistic Harvesting** brings true-to-life physics to your combine operations. No more harvesting at full throttle through dense wheat fields! Your combine will respond realistically to crop density, header width, and engine capacity - just like in real farming.

### The Problem
In vanilla FS25, combines can harvest any crop at maximum speed, regardless of density or header size. This breaks immersion and makes harvesting too easy.

### The Solution
This mod adds:
- ✅ **Automatic speed limiting** based on real-time engine load
- ✅ **Realistic productivity tracking** in tons per hour
- ✅ **Visual feedback** showing exactly what's happening with icon-based HUD
- 🚧 **Crop loss visualization** (visual indicator only in v1.0 - full simulation coming soon!)

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔧 Realistic Load Calculation
Your combine's speed is **automatically adjusted** based on:
- **Crop Density**: Denser crops like corn slow you down more than wheat
- **Header Width**: Wider headers process more material, increasing load
- **Engine Capacity**: Each combine has realistic performance limits
- **Real-time Physics**: Load is calculated dynamically every frame

### 📊 Information HUD
A **sleek, icon-based display** near your speedometer shows:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Load** | Current engine load (0-200%) with color coding |
| **T/h** | Real-time productivity in tons per hour |
| **Loss** | Crop loss indicator *(visual only in v1.0 - always shows 0%)* |
| **Speed** | Current vs. recommended speed *(shown when Speed Limiting is OFF)* |

**HUD Features:**
- Color-coded warnings (Green → Yellow → Red)
- Real-time productivity tracking
- Minimal, non-intrusive design
- Custom icons for each metric

### ⚠️ Crop Loss System *(Coming Soon!)*

> **Note:** In version 1.2.0.0, crop loss is a **visual indicator only**. It always shows 0% and does not affect your actual yield. Full crop loss simulation will be added in a future update!

**Planned for v1.3+:**
- Real yield reduction when overloading
- Loss calculation based on overload severity

## 🎮 Difficulty Modes

Choose your experience in **Game Settings** (`ESC → Settings → Realistic Harvesting`):

### 🎪 Arcade Mode
- **Minimal speed restrictions**
- Relaxed, forgiving gameplay
- Great for learning or casual farming
- Max Load: **200%** (double engine power!)

### ⚖️ Normal Mode  
- **Balanced experience**
- Feel the weight of heavy crops
- Realistic but not punishing
- Max Load: **120%**

### 🎯 Realistic Mode
- **Hardcore simulation**
- Speed strictly limited by physics
- True-to-life combine operation
- Max Load: **100%** (real-world limits)

## ⚙️ Settings & Customization

### In-Game Settings
Access via `ESC → Settings → Realistic Harvesting`:

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Difficulty** | Arcade / Normal / Realistic | Choose your physics model |
| **Show HUD** | ON / OFF | Toggle info display |
| **Speed Limiting** | ON / OFF | Enable automatic speed control |
| **Crop Loss** | ON / OFF | Toggle loss indicator *(visual only in v1.2)* |

---

## 🌐 Multiplayer Support

✅ **Fully compatible with multiplayer!**

### How It Works:
- Each player sees their own HUD
- Speed limiting applies to the combine (not the driver)
- Settings are saved **per-client**
- Host and clients can have different HUD preferences
- Calculations are synchronized across the network

### Best Practice:
For the best MP experience, all players should use the **same difficulty setting**.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### HUD not showing?
- Check if "Show HUD" is enabled in settings
- Make sure you're in a combine harvester

### Speed not limiting?
- Verify "Speed Limiting" is ON
- Check your difficulty mode (Arcade has minimal limits)
- Ensure you're harvesting (not just driving empty)

### Settings not saving?
- Settings are stored in:
  ```
  Documents/My Games/FarmingSimulator2025/savegame1/FS25_RealisticHarvesting.xml
  ```
- Delete this file to reset to defaults
