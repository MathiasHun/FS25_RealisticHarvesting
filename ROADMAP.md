## 🔥 Major Update: v2.0.0 - Real Crop Loss

**Status:** Planned

Finally, the highly requested feature!

**What's Coming:**
- ⚠️ **Actual yield reduction** when overloading your combine
- 📊 **Visual feedback** showing crop loss percentage
- ⚙️ **Balanced for all difficulties:**
  - Arcade: Minimal/no losses
  - Normal: Moderate losses if you push hard
  - Realistic: Significant losses require careful management
- 🎮 **Fully configurable** - disable if you want visual-only mode

This will completely transform the gameplay - you'll need to find the balance between speed and efficiency!

## 🎓 Future: v2.5/3.0 - Advanced Simulation

**Status:** Research Phase

For hardcore simulation fans who want the ultimate realism:

**Manual Combine Configuration System**
Adjust your combine settings for each crop type:
- 🔧 Drum/Rotor RPM
- 💨 Fan speed
- 🌾 Sieve opening
- 📏 Feeder house height

**How It Works:**
- Each crop has optimal settings (e.g., corn needs 600 RPM, wheat needs 800 RPM)
- Wrong settings = reduced efficiency and more crop loss
- Auto-configuration available for casual players
- Manual tuning required only on "Simulation" difficulty

**Example:**
Harvesting corn with wheat settings? You'll see reduced yield and warnings in the HUD. Adjust your settings, and efficiency improves!

> ⚠️ **Note:** This feature will be **completely optional**. Arcade and Normal modes will continue to work as they do now. This is for players who want that extra layer of depth.

## 📅 Release Philosophy

**Our Approach:**
1. **Foundation First:** Getting core mechanics perfect before adding complexity
2. **Community Driven:** Your feedback shapes our priorities
3. **Quality Over Speed:** We'd rather delay than release broken features
4. **Backwards Compatible:** Updates won't break your savegames
